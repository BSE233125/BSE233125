# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Hissan Ateeq
A simple web-based Hotel Management System built using PHP and MySQL.
It features separate dashboards for administrators and staff, allowing efficient management of guests, rooms, bookings, payments, and hotel staff records. The system includes real-time room availability tracking, booking and check-in/check-out handling, and payment linking. It also implements a secure session-based login system for role-based access control. This project demonstrates core database concepts such as ERD, RDM, CRUD operations, and user authentication, while offering a modern, responsive interface for smooth hotel operations.
